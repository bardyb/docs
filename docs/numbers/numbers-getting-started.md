## Introduction

Gain trust with your customers and become a familiar face in the local markets of Australia, Estonia, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Jersey - British Isles, Thailand, the Philippines, Chile and Hong Kong when you use the Sinch Numbers API to enable your customers to call and text using unique, dedicated, free and anonymous mobile originated (MO) virtual numbers to protect peopleâ€™s sensitive information and create a fraud proof service via number masking.  

The Numbers API uses [client_id and secret](https://dashboard.sinch.com/settings/access-keys) to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys [here](https://dashboard.sinch.com/settings/access-keys).

Authentication to the API is performed via [HTTP Basic Auth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). Use your client_id as the basic auth username and your secret as the password.

```curl --request GET \
 --url 'https://numbers.api.sinch.com/v1alpha1/projects/{projectId}/availableNumbers?regionCode=US' \
 --header 'Accept: application/json' \
 -u {clientId}:{clientSecret}
 ```
  We also support [OAuth](https://developers.sinch.com/reference#active-number) for short lived tokens. To get an OAuth token, you will post your client_id and secret to the Sinch endpoint.

  ```curl 
  --url 'https://auth.sinch.com/oauth2/token' -d grant_type=client_credentials --user <client_id>:<client_secret>
 ```

 You then will use the token generated by the above as the bearer in your requests.
